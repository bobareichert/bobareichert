## 🎯 **What I Do in 10 Seconds**

**Problem:** Health plans lose hundreds of millions when Star Ratings drop (Humana lost $150-200M in 2024)

**Solution:** I build AI systems that predict quality measure gaps 6-12 months early

**Results:** 
- 💰 **$13M-$27M** annual value per 100K members
- ⭐ **91%** prediction accuracy across 12 HEDIS measures
- 🚀 **<100ms** API response time, production-ready
- 🏥 **HIPAA-compliant** architecture
